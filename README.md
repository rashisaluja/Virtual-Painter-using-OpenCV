# Virtual-Painter-using-OpenCV
This is a real time painting project which allows you tp paint using 
one finger and select different colours using two fingers. It also 
has the feature to erase what you have painted.

I have also created a module which can be used in any python file to 
detect hands, detect the landmarks on hands and check which fingers are 
up.

## Technologies used:
1. Python
2. Libraries : cv2, time, os, mediapipe and imutils
3. IDE : PyCharm

## Steps:
1. Detect the hand
2. Retrieve the loacation of landmarks on the hand
3. Check which fingers are up
5. If index and middle finger are up : Selection mode
6. If only index finger is up : Drawing mode
